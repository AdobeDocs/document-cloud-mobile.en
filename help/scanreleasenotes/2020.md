## November

### Scan Android 

* Organize files: new icons showing actions, folders inline with docs, users can see parent folders when in a subfolder so it’s easier to navigate. Can easily create folders in folder on the fly (and rename). Empty folder graphic shows what’s empty. Can move folders around on the fly via context menu. Can select any number of files/folders and move all at once. Can also delete folders via context menu. Folder actions are stored in DC so the changes propagate across all platforms. 
* Protected file handling
* Quick actions: during a scan workflow, menu appears below which allows emailing, calling, selecting text, etc.. Skips a lot of steps and allows workflows with other apps with less steps (launching phone app, email app, etc.). OCR must be enabled. Disabling OCR disables quick actions because the latter depends on the former. 
  
### Scan iOS: 

* Ability to rotate images when cropping. 
* Ability to adjust scanned document size after scanning. Identical with what Android already rolled out.
