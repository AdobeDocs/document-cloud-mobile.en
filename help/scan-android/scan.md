# Scanning {#scanning}

The free Adobe Scan app turns your device into a powerful portable scanner that recognizes text automatically (OCR). Capture new images with your camera or grab any image from your device. The app converts images to PDF and saves them to Adobe Document Cloud. By default, the app automatically converts image text to real text  via optical character recognition (OCR). 

## Scanning: Quick steps {#scanning:-quick-steps}

If auto-capture is enabled, simply open the app, wait for the capture, and tap on the thumbnail to view and/or edit your scan.

## Scanning from the capture window {#scanning-from-the-capture-window}

To scan a document:

1. *Optional*: :ref:`optional` include setting the flash, selecting the document type, and so on. 
1. Invoke a scan. The app has two capture modes: 

    * ![image](./images/autoscan.png) By default, auto-capture is enabled, and on startup the app displays the capture screen and  tries to detect a document. 
    * ![image](./images/autoscanoff.png) If auto-capture is disabled, center a document in window and tap the capture button.

1. Follow the on screen hints. The app uses auto crop and image cleaning to improve scan quality. Messages appear on the screen as follows:

    * *Looking for document*: The app is looking for the document and trying to detect its boundaries.
    * *Capturing... hold steady*: Edge detection can see the entire document.
    * *No document found. Capture manually*: The app cannot detect the document edges. 
   
1. Edit your scan as described below. 
1. Tap **Save PDF** to automatically convert your scan to a PDF and save to Adobe Document Cloud.

 

### Optional steps {#optional-steps}

Use the options on the capture screen to control how you scan : 

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Document type | Streamline your workflow by selecting one of the :ref:`scantype`. |
| |flashiconon| | If your device has a flash, you can set it to always on |flashiconon|, always off |flashiconoff|, or auto |flashiconauto| (only use in dark settings). |
| |autoscan| | Toggle auto capture on |autoscan| and off |autoscanoff|. |
| |scanaddicon| | Add an existing photo or document to your current scan collection |

### Document types {#document-types}

Selecting a scan type changes the scan name as well as how the app captures the scan. For example, the app captures the entire camera view for a whiteboard but uses boundary detection when capturing a business card.

Whiteboard:

* File name: Whiteboard  + (date)
* Full screen capture
* ![image](./images/commenticon.png) shown as the 3rd option on file card

Form:

* File name: Form  + (date)
* Boundary detection
* ![image](./images/fillsignicon.png) shown as the 3rd option on file card

Document:

* File name: Scan  + (date)
* Boundary detection
* ![image](./images/commenticon.png) shown as the 3rd option on file card

Business Card:

* File name: Business Card  + (date)
* Boundary detection
* ![image](./images/contacts1.png) shown as the 3rd option on file card
