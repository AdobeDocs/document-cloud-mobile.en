## Add business card scans to contacts {#add-business-card-scans-to-contacts}

For scans the app recognizes as a business card, you can save contact information from the card to your contacts list.

On the preview screen, you may also see a notification that says "This looks like a business card. . .".

If you've installed Acrobat Reader, tap ![image](./images/fillsignicon.png) to open your PDF scan in that app. You can then add form fields such as text fields and check boxes. You can fill out the fields, or you can send the file to others for fill in.

Fill & Sign on Android supports creating and editing forms, automatic form fill-in based on suggestions, clearing form data history, signing, pasting copied text into text fields, undo/redo, and deleting form fields. For details, refer to the on-device Acrobat Reader Help.

## Add photos to a scan {#add-photos-to-a-scan}

Integration with the device photo library allows you to easily browse your photo library and add images to new or existing scans.

By showing you document-specific images first, it's easier to find and work with what you actually need.

There are two methods:  

* Add images during a current capture: tap ![image](./images/scanaddicon.png) on the capture screen, or 
* Add images to an existing scan: 

    1. Open a scan.
