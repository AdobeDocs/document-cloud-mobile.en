## Setting permissions {#setting-permissions}

Providing Adobe Scan with access to your camera is required. Allowing storage of local files and providing access to your contacts also streamlines workflows. 

If you have not preconfigured permissions during the install, when the app needs access to the camera or other device functionality, you will be prompted to provide access. 

You can grant or revoke permissions whenever you like: 

1. Go to your device's settings. 
1. Tap **Apps > Adobe Scan > Permissions**. 
1. Tap the permission you want to enable or disable.

## Text recognition settings (OCR) {#text-recognition-settings-(ocr)}

### Disabling text recognition {#disabling-text-recognition}

1. Disable **Run text recognition on saved PDF**.

   >[!NOTE]
