# Settings {#settings}

Adobe Scan work in tandem with your device settings to help you pre-configure scan workflows so that your experience is better and your scans more efficient.

## Scan app settings {#scan-app-settings}

Adobe Scan settings allow you to control features such as cellular data usage, text recognition, and so on. To change your settings: 

1. Open the app and log in.

## Enable-disable cellular data {#enable-disable-cellular-data}

When the device's settings screen opens, disable/enable Scan's ability to use cell data. 


## Text recognition settings (OCR) {#text-recognition-settings-(ocr)}

### Disabling text recognition {#disabling-text-recognition}

1. Enable **Let me adjust borders after each scan**.

## Capture screen settings {#capture-screen-settings}

### Auto scan {#auto-scan}

Enabling auto scan allows the app to automatically detect borders and capture images. Crop handles immediately appear on the capture so that you can adjust on the fly. Disabling auto scan allows you to quickly tap and scan multiple page; in this case, you'll adjust borders later. 

Enable and disable auto-capture from the capture screen: 

1. Initiate a scan. 
1. Tap ![image](./images/autoscan.png) **Auto-Capture On**.

When disabled, the icon changes to ![image](./images/autoscanoff.png) **Auto-Capture Off**. To capture an image, tap the shutter button.

### Controlling the flash {#controlling-the-flash}

For devices equipped with a flash, you set it to always on, always off, or auto (only use in dark settings):

1. Initiate a scan. 
1. Tap the icon to toggle through the options: 

    * ![image](./images/flashiconon.png)
    * ![image](./images/flashiconoff.png)
    * ![image](./images/flashiconauto.png)

An *A* appears next to the flash icon when set to automatic.

## Connecting an email app {#connecting-an-email-app}

If you've set up an email account on your iOS device, an email option appears as one of the share options in the file context menu. The ![image](./images/emailicon.png) does not appear if you have not connected an email account. 

To configure an email account:

## Allowing access to device features {#allowing-access-to-device-features}

Adobe Scan requires access to your camera. After you install the app, you'll be prompted to allow camera access as well as whether or not you'd like to receive push notifications. However, you can configure permissions at a later time.

To set permissions: 

1. Go to your device's settings. 
1. Scroll to Adobe Scan. 
1. Tap the feature you want to configure.

## Dark mode {#dark-mode}

For users of iOS 13+, the October, 2019 release supports dark mode. Dark mode's high contrast display may improve readability in low light environments as well as extend battery life. For some users, dark mode is an important accessibility feature that maintains color meaning and preserves image representation better than the night mode feature.

1. Go to your device's settings screen. 
1. Tap **Display and Brightness**. 
1. Choose light or dark mode.
