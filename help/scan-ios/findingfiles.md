## Access scans from other apps {#access-scans-from-other-apps}

Any app that supports working with PDF can access the scan app's PDF list. This allows you to attach, view, and perform other supported actions within those 3rd party apps. 

## Import photos to Adobe Scan {#import-photos-to-adobe-scan}

Document detection for the add-from-photos feature means the app tries to distinguish documents from selfies, artwork, and other non-document photos. By showing you document-specific images first, it's easier to find and work with what you actually need. Integration with the device photo library allows you to easily browse your photo library and add images to new or existing scans. 

To access this feature: 

1. Tap ![image](./images/addphotoicon.png) on the capture screen or file browser. While reviewing a current scan, you can also tap ![image](./images/scanaddicon.png) in the bottom menu and tap **Select from Photos**. Photos from last month appear by default.
1. If you don't see what you need, tap **Show More Documents** or **Show All Photos**. 
1. Tap a thumbnail to select one or more files. 
1. Tap the checkmark to finish adding the photo to your scan.
