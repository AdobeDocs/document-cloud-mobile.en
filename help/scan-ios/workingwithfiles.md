## Add business card scans to contacts {#add-business-card-scans-to-contacts}

If you've selected **Business Card** during the scan or the scan app determines the scan is a business card, you can save the scan details directly to your contacts list. After the text recognition process completes, a Save Contact icon appears on the document card thumbnail. On the preview screen, you may also see a "This looks like a business card. . ." message.

### Renaming suggestions {#renaming-suggestions}

When the app recognizes document text, the rename dialog invoked from the review screen displays suggestions based on the recognized text. These suggestions only appear when OCR occurs on the device. Only date suggestions are available for server-based OCR (for example, with business cards). Note that suggestions do not appear when renaming a file from the Preview, Recent, or All Scans views. 

To use the suggestions, simply tap those you'd like to use. 

![image](./images/suggestions.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > Suggestions derive form the local, scanned document. Suggestions do not originate from, and are not stored on, Document Cloud. You can disable OCR entirely from the Preferences screen.

### Changing the default name {#changing-the-default-name}

While the default scan name is "Scan + Date", you can change the default name in renaming workflows for documents that recognize text. The new default name applies to all new scans. You can also set the default name from the app's preferences screen.

To change the default name: 

1. Scan a document with text. 
1. Tap the ![image](./images/pencilicon.png)
1. In the rename dialog, tap Edit Default Name.

## Modify existing scans {#modify-existing-scans}

You can modify scans after they are converted to PDF. The feature allows you to organize, crop, and enhance scans at any time. To use this feature: 

1. Do one of the following: 

* Open a PDF scan in the preview screen. 
* For any thumbnail in the file list, tap ![image](./images/overflowicon.png)
 
1. Tap ![image](./images/modifyicon.png)
1. Modify your scan as needed.

Note that you cannot modify scanned files which have been altered outside of Adobe Scan. For example, if you have opened a scan in Acrobat and have added comments, added attachments, organized pages, and so on, Adobe Scan will not be able to modify that file.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > For details about editing scans, see [Scanning Documents](scan.md).

## Add photos to a scan {#add-photos-to-a-scan}

Document detection for the add-from-photos feature means the app tries to distinguish documents from selfies, artwork, and other non-document photos. By showing you document-specific images first, it's easier to find and work with what you actually need. Integration with the device photo library allows you to easily browse your photo library and add images to new or existing scans. 

To access this feature: 

1. Tap ![image](./images/addphotoicon.png) on the capture screen or file browser. While reviewing a current scan, you can also tap ![image](./images/scanaddicon.png) in the bottom menu and tap **Select from Photos**. Photos from last month appear by default.
1. If you don't see what you need, tap **Show More Documents** or **Show All Photos**. 
1. Tap a thumbnail to select one or more files. 
1. Tap the checkmark to finish adding the photo to your scan. 


## Printing {#printing}

Printing uses your device's printing capabilities. You can set up a printer ahead of time or at the time of printing.

1. Open a PDF. 
1. Tap ![image](./images/overflowicon.png) and then ![image](./images/printicon.png) 
1. In the Printer Options dialog, select a printer.
1. Use the + and - buttons to set the number of copies to print.
1. Tap Print.


   >[!NOTE]
