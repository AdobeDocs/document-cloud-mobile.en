## Getting started {#getting-started}

Adobe Scan requires that you log in with a supported ID  since features such as conversion of text in images to actual text (optical character recognition) use services in the Adobe Cloud. Use an existing Adobe, Google, or Facebook ID or create a new Adobe ID at ``https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html``. 

* Install: 

    * **Mobile**: Download and configure the free Adobe Scan mobile app from the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Samsung Galaxy Store.
    * **Web**: Bookmark the Adobe Document Cloud website so you can access your files from any location. 
    * **Desktop**: Sign in to Acrobat on your desktop so that your files are always available in Acrobat. 
    
* Configure: Once you've installed the app, make sure it's set up to do what you need by configuring the :ref:`settings` in the app's preference panel as well as those on the capture screen. Some of the features you can control include:
