## Errors and issues {#errors-and-issues}

**Why is the app asking for photo and camera access?**

To use the camera or photo, you must provide the app access. For configuration details, see :ref:`settingsaccess`.

**Why can't I install Adobe Scan on my device?**

The app can only be installed on 64-bit devices with iOS 10.0 and later.

**Refresh failed. Please check your network connection.**

* Verify you have a good network connection. For example, open a browser and try to open a web page. 
* If you do not have wifi enabled, verify you have checked **Allow Upload on Cellular**.

**Why do I see "Unable to Modify Scan: Files that have been altered outside of Adobe Scan cannot be modified"?**

You cannot modify scanned files which have been altered outside of Adobe Scan. For example, if you have opened a scan in Acrobat and have added comments, added attachments, organized pages, and so on, Adobe Scan will not be able to modify that file.

## Troubleshooting OCR {#troubleshooting-ocr}

**Why can't I select, edit, and comment or markup text in my OCR'ed document?**

Working with converted text requires Acrobat Reader. While you can open and preview your OCR'ed scan in Adobe Scan, you need to install Acrobat Reader and tap **Open in Acrobat** to work with the text.

**Why does OCR not appear to work on parts of my document?**

Because OCR is a complex conversion that relies on consuming recognizable text, certain document characteristics may degrade the quality of optical character recognition output. For example, the following conditions may impair OCR quality: 

* A dark colored background
* A source document with multiple languages
* A rotated source document
* Scanning under light conditions that are too bright or dark
* A network connection and an Adobe Document Cloud connection is required

**Why does OCR text recognition not work or produce a result in English?**

The app is localized in 19 languages and supports text recognition for all of those languages. However, note the following:  

* If the app is installed on an OS using an unsupported language, the default output is English. 
* If you've selected a language to recognize that doesn't match the document language, OCR produces no output. For example, the scanned document is German and you set Danish as the text recognition language.
