## Finding files {#finding-files}

Acrobat Reader provides a number of ways to help you find files, file content, and folders. When no file is open, the bottom menu displays available locations:

* **Home**: When you start Acrobat, the Home screen shows you all of your files regardless of location with the most recently viewed files at the top of the list. 
* **Files**: The Files list allows you to select a local or cloud based location.
* **Shared**: When you're signed in, the Shared file list displays files shared by you or by others with you. These include both view-only files as well as review files which allow comments. 
* **Search**: Search provides a way to find all the files and file content that match your search parameters.

### Recent files {#recent-files}

To see a list of recently viewed files, tap **Home**. 

### Searching for files {#searching-for-files}

Acrobat searches local and Document Cloud files. It does not search files in other cloud storage locations. Search for a file by title or type as follows: 

1. With no file open, tap ![image](./images/searchicon.png)
1. Enter the search term.
1. Tap the keyboard arrow. 

 When the search result appears, you further refine the result by tapping on a file location.

## Cloud-based files {#cloud-based-files}

Acrobat Reader integrates with Adobe Document Cloud, Dropbox, and Google Drive so that you can easily work with files in any location. Edited cloud-based PDF on your device automatically save back to the original cloud location.  

Dropbox and Google Drive users can install the apps or simply add their accounts on-the-fly to enable one-touch access to those locations. All scenarios allow you to open cloud-based files in Acrobat Reader and save edited files back to the original location.
