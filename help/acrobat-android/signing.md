## Frequently asked questions {#frequently-asked-questions}

**Why can't I sign a document?**

You cannot sign shared files, including shared for view-only and shared for review files. Also, secured documents restrict certain types of edits, including signing.

**Why can't I delete a signature in a document?**

Once a document is saved, the PDF is flattened and the signature cannot be removed.

**Why don't I see my comments, form data, or signatures in my PDF?**

It may be that you are not using Adobe's Acrobat Reader. Other PDF viewers may not support all the features that Adobe's Acrobat Reader supports. View your PDFs with Acrobat Reader, and if you send it to someone else, encourage the recipient to do the same.

**How can I display a list of signatures in a document?**

This feature is currently unsupported.

**Can I sign a password protected PDFs?**

No.
