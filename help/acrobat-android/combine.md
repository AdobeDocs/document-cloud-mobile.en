## Combining files {#combining-files}

Subscribers to Adobe Acrobat Premium or Adobe Acrobat Pro DC  can combine up to 12 files into a single PDF. You can also combine files from any integrated file location such as Dropbox and Drive. 

Note the following constraints: 

* You cannot combine files that are shared for review. 
* You must log in to Document Cloud to combine files.
* The online service requires an internet connection. 
* Combining files requires a subscription. 


### Combining unopened files (method 1) {#combining-unopened-files-(method-1)}

1. Long press a file until a checkmark appears. 
1. Tap more files as needed: select up to 12 unshared files.
1. Tap ![image](./images/overflowicon| > |combineicon.png). If you select non-PDF files, they are converted to PDF on-the-fly. 
1. *Optional*: Reorder files by tapping or long pressing ![image](./images/reordericon.png) and dragging it to a new location. You can also remove files from the combine list.
1. *Optional*: Tap ![image](./images/pencilicon.png) next to the file title and enter a new name. By default, the name is "Combine + (current date)".

## Compress files {#compress-files}

Sometimes working with smaller file sizes is easier and faster--operations on large files can take longer and/or consume more bandwidth. Premium users can compress files to reduce their size. Files must not have been previously compressed. 

   ![image](../imagesandroid/contextmenu1.png)

To compress a file: 

1. Tap ![image](./images/overflowicon.png) > **Compress PDF**.
1. *Optional*. After compression completes, tap **Open** to open the file. 
1. After compression, the file is save backed to original location; for example, to the device, Adobe Document Cloud, Google Drive, etc.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > File compression is only available for files which have not already been compressed in any app (including desktop Acrobat). Attempting compression on a file which has already been compressed results in an error.
