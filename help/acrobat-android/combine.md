# Combining and compressing files


## Combining files


Subscribers to Adobe Acrobat Premium or Adobe Acrobat Pro DC can combine
up to 12 files into a single PDF. You can also combine files from any
integrated file location such as Dropbox and Drive.

Note the following constraints:

* You cannot combine files that are shared for review.
* You must log in to Document Cloud to combine files.
* The online service requires an internet connection.
* Combining files requires a subscription.

### Combining unopened files (method 1)

You can invoke the combine file workflow from a file list:

1.  Log in to Document Cloud.
2.  Go to the Home or Files file list.
3.  Long press a file until a checkmark appears.
4.  Tap more files as needed: select up to 12 unshared files.
5.  Tap ![overflowicon](../imagesandroid/overflowicon.png) \>
    ![combineicon](../imagesandroid/combineicon.png). If you select
    non-PDF files, they are converted to PDF on-the-fly.
6.  *Optional*: Reorder files by tapping or long pressing
    ![reordericon](../imagesandroid/reordericon.png) and dragging it to
    a new location. You can also remove files from the combine list.
7.  *Optional*: Tap ![pencilicon](../imagesandroid/pencilicon.png) next
    to the file title and enter a new name. By default, the name is
    \"Combine + (current date)\".
8.  Tap **Combine**.

The file is automatically sent to Adobe\'s Combine service and uploaded
to Document Cloud.

## Compress files


Sometimes working with smaller file sizes is easier and
faster\--operations on large files can take longer and/or consume more
bandwidth. Premium users can compress files to reduce their size. Files
must not have been previously compressed.

To compress a file:

1.  Tap ![overflowicon](../imagesandroid/overflowicon.png) \> **Compress
    PDF**.
2.  *Optional*. After compression completes, tap **Open** to open the
    file.
3.  After compression, the file is save backed to original location; for
    example, to the device, Adobe Document Cloud, Google Drive, etc.

>File compression is only available for files which have not already been compressed in any app (including desktop Acrobat). Attempting compression on a file which has already been compressed results in an error.
