# What's New {#what's-new}

In addition to bug fixes and performance enhancements, keeping your app up-to-date guarantees that you'll always have the latest and greatest new features.

October:

* Acrobat Android: none
* Acrobat iOS: 
  
  * Intune and enterprise mobile management enhancements, including support for OneDrive as well as the ability to fine tune access to 3rd party clouds and Document Cloud. 
  * OneDrive access from within the app. 
  * 2 up page view. I haven’t been able to figure out what this is yet. . . 

* Scan Android and iOS: none

November

* Acrobat Android: None that I know of. Ask Shilpi/Neha to verify. Report back if you learn something. 
* Acrobat iOS: don’t see anything end user facing. Phased rollout of changes. 
* Scan Android 

  * Organize files: new icons showing actions, folders inline with docs, users can see parent folders when in a subfolder so it’s easier to navigate. Can easily create folders in folder on the fly (and rename). Empty folder graphic shows what’s empty. Can move folders around on the fly via context menu. Can select any number of files/folders and move all at once. Can also delete folders via context menu. Folder actions are stored in DC so the changes propagate across all platforms. 
  * Protected file handling
    * Quick actions: during a scan workflow, menu appears below which allows emailing, calling, selecting text, etc.. Skips a lot of steps and allows workflows with other apps with less steps (launching phone app, email app, etc.). OCR must be enabled. Disabling OCR disables quick actions because the latter depends on the former. 
  
* Scan iOS: 

  * Ability to rotate images when cropping. 
  * Ability to adjust scanned document size after scanning. Identical with what Android already rolled out.
