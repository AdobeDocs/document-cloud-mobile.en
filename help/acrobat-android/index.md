# Getting Started {#getting-started}

Acrobat Reader DC delivers one-click integration with  Adobe Scan and as well as enterprise-class PDF workflow features. Enterprise configuration options support managing your work and personal files as needed. An intuitive user interface works similarly across phones, desktop, and the browser. Now you can start a collaborative review at work, check review status and comment PDFs on the train, and access any PDF workflow on the web. 

Whether you're at work or on the go, your files are simply accessible whenever you need them: 

* **Mobile**: Manage work and personal files from any location on your phone or tablet. 
* **Web**: Access files on Adobe Document Cloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, or any other location accessible on your device.
