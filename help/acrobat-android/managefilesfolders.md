## Cloud-based files {#cloud-based-files}

Acrobat Reader integrates with Adobe Document Cloud, Dropbox, and Google Drive so that you can easily work with files in any location. Edited cloud-based PDF on your device automatically save back to the original cloud location.  

Dropbox and Google Drive users can install the apps or simply add their accounts on-the-fly to enable one-touch access to those locations. All scenarios allow you to open cloud-based files in Acrobat Reader and save edited files back to the original location.

## Opening PDFs from email and browsers {#opening-pdfs-from-email-and-browsers}

Adobe recommends viewing PDFs in Acrobat Reader because other viewers (for example, Google's  built-in PDF viewer and other PDF apps) may not display items such as sticky notes, highlight, freehand drawing, handwritten signatures, filled form data, and other items. These items will display if you view your PDF in Acrobat. You can open a PDF in Acrobat from other applications, including:

* Email
* Browsers

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > In workflows that ask you whether to open Acrobat just once or always, choosing **Always** sets Acrobat as the default PDF viewer. Doing so ensures broad support for the PDF standard, provides a long list of free PDF features such as sharing, commenting, and so on, and provides one-click integration with the Scan app. 

### Email {#email}

1. Open the PDF attachment (typically a long press). 
1. When asked how to complete the action, choose Adobe Acrobat.
1. Tap **Always** or **Just Once**.
