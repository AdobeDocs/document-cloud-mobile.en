**Issue**: The Restore Purchases workflow breaks after Acrobat on Android updates from a store that's different from the original install store. 
 
**Details**:  When Acrobat on Android updates manually or automatically from a store which is different from the original installing store, the restore subscription workflow breaks. For example, downloading from Google's app store but updating via Samsung's app store, tapping **Subscriptions > Restore Purchases** results in an dialog which asks you to reinstall the app. 
 
To fix this issue, backup your data and reinstall the app as follows: 
 
1. Back up your data. Note that files listed in the Recent list are likely already backed up. With Acrobat open and a network connection, cloud files should already be synced. The local storage area Acrobat automatically uses is deleted when the app is uninstalled. 

   1. From the Home view, tap **Files > On this Device**. 
   2. For every file you need to back up, tap ![image](./images/overflowicon.png)
   3. Choose **Save a Copy**, select a location (local, Document Cloud, or a connected 3rd party storage solution), and  complete the workflow.

2. Uninstall the app via the standard method on your device. 
3. Reinstall the app from the app store where you originally purchased your subscription.
