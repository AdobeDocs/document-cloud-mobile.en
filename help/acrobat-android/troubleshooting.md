## FAQs {#faqs}

**Why did my menus change or disappear?**

When a file is open, a single tap changes the view to immersive mode. Immersive mode hides the menus so that you can see more of the document. 

The menu varies based on the  viewing context. For example, items in the top menu bar change depending on whether you're viewing a private file, a shared file, or a review file.

**How do I force stop Acrobat Reader?**

It is sometimes useful to stop the application to clear the memory, reset the cache, etc. To do so, do one of the following:

* Tap your device's Recent Apps button, and swipe the app away.
* Go to **Settings > Application manager > Adobe Acrobat > Force Stop**.
