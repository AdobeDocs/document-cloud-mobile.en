## Menus {#menus}

**Why did my menus change or disappear?**

When a file is open, a single tap changes the view to immersive mode. Immersive mode hides the menus so that you can see more of the document. 

The menu varies based on the  viewing context. For example, items in the top menu bar change depending on whether you're viewing a private file, a shared file, or a review file.
