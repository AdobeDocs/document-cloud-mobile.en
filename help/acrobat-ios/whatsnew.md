New Connector: OneDrive 
With this release we will provide individual and business users with the ability to link OneDrive accounts within acrobat. Along with being a popular request this also should help with increasing doc opens. 
 
Enterprise 
This release addresses the request to manage the file system restrictions in the application. We will be providing with enterprise configurations to restrict data access from and to the file systems. This goes a long way towards completing our enterprise story for Acrobat mobile. 
 
2 Up Page View 
In this release we provide our users with a way to view a document in a 2-page mode, where they can see two pages of a PDF document side-by-side.  Note this is available for iPAD users only. 
 
LM and CoD 
This release contains many fixes that dramatically improve the accessibility experience for LM users, including Voice Over.  Also, with this release, we start to rollout the Colorado on Device functionality to our customers.   
 
Share & Review 
The changes to link creation workflow enhance the usability and add the stability to the feature. 
 
Crash data Collection 
The migration to AppCenter SDK for crash data collection is completed. With this release we have added user settings and added the capability to collect extension crash data for the first time.
