# Opening Files in Acrobat {#opening-files-in-acrobat}

For many users, PDFs arrive on their device via a browser, email, or some other non-Adobe app. It's easy to make these PDFs available in Acrobat, and you can quickly configure many apps and device features so that Acrobat is an integrated part of viewing, sharing, and reviewing workflows. 

You can open a PDF in Acrobat from any application, including:

* Apple's Files app
* Other Adobe apps such as  Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign
* Email and messaging apps
* Browsers
* Cloud storage services like Document Cloud and Dropbox

## "Copy to" vs "Open in" {#"copy-to"-vs-"open-in"}

To help you get your work done, Acrobat supports opening, sharing, and copying many document types to and from your device as well as other non-Adobe apps. Your file workflows may involve menu options for: 

* **Open in Acrobat**: The *open in* option is provided by your iOS) and results in  both Acrobat and the source app sharing a single file.  For example, when choosing "Open in" while sharing from the Files app, Acrobat uses a reference to the source file. The file is not copied to Acrobat. Any changes made to the file in Acrobat save those changes back to the original file. 

* **Copy to**: Alternatively, *copy to* copies the file to Acrobatâ€™s local documents cache which only Acrobat may access.  Changes are saved to Acrobat's private copy and the original file remains unchanged. 

Note that workflows might use both the **Open In** and **Copy To** features since Acrobat makes copied files accessible to other apps. For example, you can "Copy To" a file from Mail into Acrobat and then use the Files app to "Open In" that same file into PDF Expert. Similarly, from PDF Expert you may choose **"Import From" > Choose files**, and browse to Acrobat to open a file. Changes made in these external apps are saved back to Acrobat.

## Why use Acrobat? {#why-use-acrobat?}

Adobe recommends viewing PDFs in Acrobat Reader because other viewers (for example, Apple's built-in PDF viewer and other PDF apps) do not display items such as sticky notes, highlight, freehand drawing, handwritten signatures, filled form data, etc. To use these cool features, simply copy the file to Acrobat. 

## Adding Acrobat to the Share menu {#adding-acrobat-to-the-share-menu}

The most common way to open files in Acrobat is to share PDFs (open it) from other apps via the Share menu (Tap ![image](./images/shareicon.png)). Sharing a file with Acrobat simply copies the file to Acrobat, and it opens automatically.

Acrobat may not appear in the app share list by default. To add Acrobat as a default item in the share list: 

1. Open a PDF in any app.
1. Tap **Open In...** or the ![image](./images/shareicon.png) (varies by app and OS version).
1. Swipe left until the **More** icon appears, and tap it. 
1. When the app list appears, tap **Edit**. 
1. Scroll down the app list and tap **Copy to Acrobat**. 
1. Tap **Done** to exit edit mode.
1. Tap **Done** again to exit the Share settings dialog. 

You should now see Acrobat as a share choice whenever you tap the Share icon from any app.

## Files app integration {#files-app-integration}

The iOS Files App (iOS 11+) allows you to easily find, organize, and manage all of your files. Available files include not only local files on your device, but also files on other iOS devices as well as cloud services such as Adobe Document Cloud. Adobe DC mobile app support for the Files app means you have greater control and ease of access for all your files and scans no matter where they reside.

## Airdrop {#airdrop}

AirDrop enables you to wirelessly share files from one Apple device to another (iPhone to iPad to Mac).

   ![image](./images/airdropshare.png)


.. Note:: AirDrop requires that you set up the target and receiving devices as described in [Apple's instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144).
