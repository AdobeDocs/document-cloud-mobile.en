# Working with PDF {#working-with-pdf}

When you open a PDF, what menus appear will vary based on the file. Regular files (for example, those  not part of a review) display an action menu at the top of the screen and a floating action bottom at the bottom. 

Both the overflow icon (![image](./images/overflowicon.png)) and floating action button ![image](./images/editicon.png) open a context menu displaying additional options based on your service subscriptions. For example, both Organize Pages and Edit PDF require a subscription.

## Menus and viewing contexts {#menus-and-viewing-contexts}

Menu options vary based on the viewing context. The top menu bar, context menu options, and the floating action button change based on the nature of the currently displayed file: 

* Regular files (not shared or in review): The top menu contains tools for changing the view mode, undo/redo, text search, share, and an overflow menu that provide access to tools for viewing comments, viewing bookmarks, printing, and actions associated with your subscription services. A floating action button (![image](./images/editicon.png)) provides access to the tools Comments, Fill & Sign, and other subscribed services. 
* Shared files (view only): An overflow menu provide access to tools for printing and managing the shared file. 
* Review files: Files in an ongoing review display the comment bar, the comment filter, and an overflow menu that provide access to tools for managing the review. The floating action button is not available. For details, see [review](review.md).
