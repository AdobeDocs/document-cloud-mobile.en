## Scanning {#scanning}

If you've installed the [Adobe Scan app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan/id1199564834?mt=8), you can invoke it from Acrobat Reader, scan a document, and automatically convert it to PDF.

The free Adobe Scan PDF scanner app turns your device into a powerful portable PDF scanner that recognizes text automatically (OCR). Adobe Scan turns anything — receipts, notes, documents, photos, business cards, whiteboards — into an Adobe PDF with text you can reuse from each PDF and photo scan. 

In addition to creating PDFs which you can then import into Acrobat Reader, Adobe scan allows you to: 

* Edit your scan
* Add images from your device
* Reorder pages
* Crop pages
* Adjust the color
* Rotate pages
* Delete pages

file is automatically sent to Adobe's Create PDF service and uploaded to Document Cloud.
