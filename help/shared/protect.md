# Password Protect PDF {#password-protect-pdf}

Subscribers to Adobe Acrobat Premium or Adobe Acrobat Pro DC can password protect PDFs by setting a document open password. 

When you create a password for a PDF, note the following: 

* The app creates a file copy named "(the file name)_protected" and saves that file to the Document Cloud. It does not protect or change the original file. 
* Actions which change the file are blocked on mobile devices, including Fill & Sign, commenting, and editing.
* You can use the restricted features with desktop Acrobat. 
* You can remove the password with desktop Acrobat (you must know the original password). 
* There is no separate password for edit. If a user can open a file, they can edit the file.

To password protect a file from within an open PDF or from any file list:
